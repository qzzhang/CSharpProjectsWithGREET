During data collection, water use data were only requested and compiled in terms of 'evaporative' or consumptive use (i.e., ultimate withdraws, evaporation, or incorporation into the product). Data were not collected to determine reliable averages for non-evaporative water use. In other words, averages for water inputs and outputs are not available for this unit process.  Consumptive use includes: water incorporated into the product, water evaporated during the process, and/or water used and released to a body other than that from which it was drawn."
